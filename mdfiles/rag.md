# SlackGauntlet AI Response Requirements

1. User Status Management
   - Implement AI response using RAG for users that are BUSY
   - Allow users to set static custom away messages
   - Allow users to choose AI response or static custom message response when BUSY

2. Embedding Generation
   - Calculate embeddings for:
     * User's previous responses
     * Similar messages from other users
     * Conversation context
     * User's writing style
   - Update embeddings periodically
   - Handle multiple languages

3. Vector Database Management
   - Store embeddings efficiently using Pinecone
   - Implement fast similarity search
   - Regular maintenance and cleanup
   - Version control for embeddings
   - Backup and recovery procedures

4. Response Generation for Direct Messages
   - If receiving user is busy, has a custom message, and has AI response disable, use that message
   - If receiving user is busy and has AI response enabled, use AI response
   - Find most similar historical messages
   - Consider conversation context
   - Maintain user's writing style
   - Handle different types of queries:
     * Questions
     * Task requests
     * Information sharing
     * Social interactions
   - Support message threading
   - Include relevant attachments/links

5. Quality Control
   - Using summary lookup, check if the response is appropriate
   - Feedback collection and incorporation
   - Response appropriateness checking
   - Sensitive content filtering

6. Response Delivery
   - Automatic reponses will be indicated in the response
   - Custom away messages will be indicated in the response
   - Send responses with appropriate timing
   - Handle message threading correctly
   - Support rich text formatting
   - Include relevant context
   - Proper error handling

7. Integration Features
    - API endpoints for external systems
    - Webhook support
    - Custom integration options
    - Export/import capabilities
